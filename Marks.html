                <h3 class="first-mon">Inscriptions on The Cry of Balintawak Monument</h3>
            <p class="intro-1">The first marker was an inscription on the plinth of the Cry of Balintawak Monument located in Balintawak that read, “Homenaje del Pueblo Filipino a los Heroes de ‘96 / Ala-ala ng Bayang Pilipino sa mga Bayani ng ‘96”, with a smaller plaque bearing the date “26 Agosto 1896.” According to Borromeo-Buehler (1998), the traditional view of the “Cry”, later on adapted by veterans or eyewitnesses, was the basis of the monument as a commemoration of the “Unang Sigaw”. They interpret it as the “unang labanan” which refers to the first exchange of shots between Katipuneros and Spanish troops (p. 25).  </p>

            <h3 class="second-mon">the Kangkong Marker </h3>
            <p class="intro-2">Another mark supporting the same view was the Kangkong marker standing erect at the house of Apolonio Samson, a local leader of the Katipunan in Caloocan, where the decision to revolt took place. It has an inscription that says, “Sa pook na ito, ipinasya ng KKKNMANB ang paghihimagsik noong ika-23 ng Agosto 1896.”
            <p class="intro-6"> This marker was constructed in 1917 by the Labi ng Katipunan, a Katipunan veterans’ association headed by the veterans Pio H. Santos, a participant of the “Cry”, and Claudio P. Carreon (Valdez and Medina, 1996). Kangkong was also the site specified by several testimonies of veterans namely Francisco Carreon, Tomas Remigio, Julio Nakpil, Sinforoso San Pedro, Guillermo Masangkay, Cipriano Pacheco, Briccio Pantas, and Vicente Samson as to where the decisive meeting was held (Richardson, 2019).

            <h3 class="third-mon">A Joint Issue Statement</h3>
            <p class="intro-5">On the other hand, one veteran, Pio Valenzuela, opposingly claimed that the decisive meeting took place in Pasong Tamo, at the place of Melchora Aquino; therefore, the “Cry” was at Pugad Lawin since he recalled that Pugad Lawin was in Pasong Tamo. 
            </p>
            <p>In commemoration, Valenzuela together with four other KKK veterans - Gregoria de Jesus, Briccio Pantas, Alfonso Pacheco, and Cipriano Pacheco, visited Pasong Tamo in 1928. A photograph of the group was even published in the newspaper La Opinion, with a marked ‘X’ on the exact spot where they store their weapons (bolos) before they were used in the “Cry” (Guerrero, et al., 1996). </p>
            <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/katipunandocumentsandstudies/studies/notes-on-the-cry-of-august-1896">   
                <img class="pic-7" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nJwxhObIx88nKidpFiY5H35yL0H4jRg2gdp5RIumuwVK9HH-EWe_FddqUDDedDAmqP2oDlrSZh1h3KYYYJkGO3lT7f1PnxDuY_zuhVpEZZRH5q8REAYF2hFs7x-q1qgiN1jJSaNbJqY=s412" alt=""></a>
            <p class="intro-7">Around the same time, Pio Valenzuela, Briccio Pantas, and Cipriano Pacheco also issued a joint statement to authorize their claim that the “Cry” had taken place in Pugad Lawin, not where the monument was erected. 
            <p>The said statement was published in the Philippine Free Press in November of 1930 stating, “na hindi sa Balintawak ngyari ang unang sigaw ng panhihimagsik na kinalalaguian ngayon ng bantayog, kung di sa pook na kilala sa tawag na Pugad-lawin.” They also marked the site of Melchora Aquino’s house, where Valenzuela specifically stated the “Cry” took place, with a thin wooden stake. </p>
            <p>However, this published signed statement of Valenzuela, Pantas, and Pacheco  was refuted by Guillermo Masangkay pointing out that both Pantas and Valenzuela already fled the place to surrender to the Spaniards, while Pacheco was never there during the “Cry”. Furthermore, Pantas changed his account of the “Cry” stating that he was not around to witness the tearing of the cedulas nor the “unang labanan” with the Spaniards and admitted that he previously signed a fabricated account together with Valenzuela and Pacheco about the tearing of cedulas in Pugad Lawin (Borromeo-Buehler, 1998). </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Interpretation</h2>
            <p>Based on these statements, it’s safe to say that the interpretation of the “Cry” as pagpupunit and unang labanan is considered void, leaving us to the interpretation that the “Cry” meant pasya or the decision to revolt. Also with these accounts, I can say that the “Cry” may have actually happened in Balintawak where the 1911 monument was erected.
