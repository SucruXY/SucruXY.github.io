            <h2>The Controversy</h2>
            <p class="intro-1">The Cry of the Katipuneros (or the Cry of Balintawak/Pugad Lawin) was a monumental moment in Philippine history as this event was the start of the Philippine revolution against the Spanish Regime, spearheaded by Andres Bonifacio and his fellow Katipuneros’ ambition to free the Filipinos in August, 1896 (Sichrovsky, 1983). 
            </p>
            <p class="intro-1">Unfortunately, this great moment in Philippine history is clouded with controversy and differences in views and opinions on the correct name of the historic event, which is to be either the Cry of Balintawak or the Cry of Pugad Lawin. The controversy has many aspects and sides to it, and the sources of information derived from said event will aid in evaluating and analyzing what may truly be the truth. Hopefully, the conclusion that may be drawn from this discussion on The Cry will settle this long dispute.

            <h2>Things to Note</h2>
            <p class="intro-1">Prior to discussing a multitude of primary sources which can contribute to identifying the most accurate “the Cry”, some context regarding the controversy should be discussed. “The Cry” had a multitude of views and interpretations from different historians and people, such as mistakes and errors of the historians’ analysis and interpretation of the facts, mutually inconsistent statements by the participants in “the Cry”, and mishandling of important historical evidence which progressed the problem. This led to multiple differences on the date and venue of the actual event, causing “the Cry” to have two versions: one occurring in Pugad Lawin and the other in Balintawak (Borromeo-Buehler, 1998).
            </p>
            <p class="intro-1">Also to be noted that historians have a debate on what is “the Cry” exactly about. The term has been associated with three related events: <span class="spec">“pasya”  – the decision to revolt; the “pagpupunit” – the tearing of cedulas; and the “unang labanan” – the first encounter with Spanish forces.</span>
            <p class="intro-1">Thus, as many old sources do not exactly say which of the events they pertain to, the distinct event of the three must be identified from the evidences presented to allow a better determination of which is the more accurate version: the pasya, the pagpupunit or the unang labanan.</p>
            <p class="intro-1">As such, this discussion on “the Cry” will do its best to conclude two aspects of the event that has been most debated: the geography of the event, and the pasya, pagpupunit, or the unang labanan meaning of the event.</p>
            <p class="intro-1">With that being said, some analysis must be taken in order to address both sides of “the Cry” for the identification of the more accurate version: The Cry of Balintawak or the Cry of Pugad Lawin?

            <h2>Analysis on "the Cry"</h2>
              <div>
            <h3>Geography of “the Cry”</h3>
            <p class="contact-msg">Regarding the venue of “the Cry”, the evidence and sources of material discussed in the prior sections have a consistent concept that “the Cry” was related to Balintawak. The artworks and monuments all have descriptions and history behind them that points to the event occurring in Balintawak. Furthermore, statements and accounts by the Katipuneros discussed did have a consistent description that “the Cry” was in Balintawak, and that the inconsistencies of statements and evidence from the “Pugad Lawin” supporters have further cemented that the event is more accurately known as “the Cry of Balintawak”.
            </p>
             </div>
             <div>
            <h3>Which one: The Pasya, The Pagpupunit or The Unang Labanan? </h3>
            <p class="contact-msg">The meaning behind “the Cry” is truly an arduous debate, and the evidence and information provided in the discussion may not truly point to one of the three accepted meanings. Yet, this discussion has certain information that may lead to the conclusion that the event was indeed The Pasya or the decision of the Katipunan to revolt.</p>
            <p class="contact-msg">First pieces of evidence are the depictions of “the Cry” on shrines, monuments, and paintings. Consistent with almost all of these artworks is that there is no depiction of any fight or any instance of cedula-tearing, and instead, the gathering and rallying of the Katipuneros is seen all throughout these different arts. Furthermore, descriptions behind the artworks consistently explain that “the Cry” exhibits the start of the Philippine revolution, and hardly any other say on the other two possibilities. 
            </p>
            <p class="contact-msg">Second are the marks and signages, that the published signed statement of Valenzuela, Pantas, and Pacheco was refuted by Guillermo Masangkay pointing out that both Pantas and Valenzuela already fled the place to surrender to the Spaniards, while Pacheco was never there during the “Cry”. Pantas also changed his account of the “Cry” stating that he was not around to witness the tearing of the cedulas nor the “unang labanan” with the Spaniards and admitted that he previously signed a fabricated account together with Valenzuela and Pacheco about the tearing of cedulas in Pugad Lawin (Borromeo-Buehler, 1998). Based on these statements, it’s safe to say that the interpretation of the “Cry” as pagpupunit and unang labanan is considered void, leaving us to the interpretation that the “Cry” meant pasya or the decision to revolt.
            </p>
            <p class="contact-msg">Third, evaluating the statements made by several prominent figures involved in the said event points to the conclusion that “the Cry” took place in Balintawak and not in Pugad Lawin. Pio Valenzuela changed his accounts several times which allows questioning regarding the credibility of his statements. Santiago Alvarez, despite him being a well-known Katipunero, was not an eyewitness. Both Valenzuela and Alvarez accounts point to Pugad Lawin, however, due to inconsistencies, the reputation and reliability of the said accounts are crucial whether we take them into consideration or not. Masangkay, de Jesus, Nakpil, and the Guardia Civil’s report on the other hand, says otherwise. Although still with discrepancies, their accounts were heavier than Valenzuela’s and Alvarez’s due to either their relationships with Bonifacio or the consistencies in their statements.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <h3>What is the more accurate "the Cry"?</h3>
            <p class="contact-msg">According to the evidence discussed, analyzed and interpreted, the version that may truly embody the meaning of “the Cry”, the decision of the Katipunan to start the Philippine Revolution from all the sources gathered and scrutinized altogether, is The Pasya version that happened in Balintawak.
